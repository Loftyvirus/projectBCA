            BCA Question Papers is a platform designed to assist BCA students in
            their exam preparations. We provide a wide selection of past
            question papers from all BCA semesters, ensuring that students have
            reliable resources to prepare effectively.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg md:text-xl leading-relaxed mb-6">
            Instead of providing static images of past question papers, we offer
            interactive markdown files. These markdown files provide a more
            dynamic, flexible way to engage with the question papers, allowing
            you to navigate them easily and study in a more effective manner.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg md:text-xl leading-relaxed">
            Our mission is simple: To offer accessible, organized, and reliable
            study resources, enabling students to focus on what matters most â€”
            mastering their exams.
